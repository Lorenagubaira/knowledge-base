Familiarize yourself with the dashboard! The dashboard is your control center. It provides an overview of your account.

There will be shown all the available **active programs** that you have. Each program is clearly displayed, allowing you to quickly access the information you need. You can easily navigate through the dashboard to explore program details, such as how much of the course you have done so far, and keep track of how many quizzes, lessons, projects and exercises you have completed.
